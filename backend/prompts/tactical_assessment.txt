```json
{{
    "sensor_type": "radar|sonar|satellite|other",
    "observations": [
        "Key observation 1",
        "Key observation 2",
        "Key observation 3"
    ],
    "threat_level": "low|moderate|elevated|high|critical",
    "intent_analysis": "Detailed analysis of the likely enemy intent based on observed patterns and historical context. Explain the reasoning behind your assessment.",
    "confidence": "low|medium|high",
    "recommended_actions": [
        "Recommended action 1",
